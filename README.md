Hello! My name is Bunny!

**About me**
 * I enjoy messing with a lot of things, whether it's Linux, html, or even Discord bots. :D
 * I also make bash/batch scripts sometimes.
 * I use Arch, along with i3wm. ^^

**Whatcha learnin?**<br>
I'm currently Learning C, Python, and I'm trying to get into networking!
