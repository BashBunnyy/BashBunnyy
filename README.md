Hello! My name is Bunny!

**About me**
 * I enjoy messing with a lot of things, whether it's Linux, html, or even Discord bots. :D
 * I also make bash/batch scripts sometimes.
 * I use Arch, along with i3wm. ^^

**Whatcha learnin?**
I'm currently Learning C, Python, and I'm trying to get into networking!

* “Ultimately, arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.”
― Edward Snowden
